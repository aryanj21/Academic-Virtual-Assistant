However, one of the challenges is getting useful insights from the gathered data as this is a process on its own. Introduction The growing relevance of social media Information is power and, in this day and age, the Internet is increasingly becoming the primary source and vector for the transfer of information between people. Digital media is an essential source of information for people worldwide. Compared to traditional media, digital media consumption grows rapidly with each year.', 'The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to this process,1 with most work, learning, entertainment and communication in technologically advanced countries transferring to the online environment.2 Social media plays a significant role in The amount of content generated on people’s lives. There are 4.2 billion social social media is tremendous—there are media users worldwide, more than 53% 474,000 Tweets, 69 000 Instagram posts, of the world’s population. Since 2021, the and 400 hours of new Youtube videos number of social media users has grown uploaded each minute. On Facebook by 490 million, a 13% increase.3 This means alone, there are 510,000 comments, that the number of new social media users 293,000 status updates, and 136,000 photos grew by more than 900 users per minute. uploaded per minute.4 An Introduction to Media Monitoring From press clippings in the area of traditional media to online media monitoring (or sometimes also listening), online media monitoring is used to observe social media and other media on the Internet (websites, blogs, news, etc.).', 'Tools to conduct monitoring ���������������������������������������������������������������������������� 5can vary, from a simple Excel sheet, to using a specific tool to analyse data. In addition, there are possibilities to analyse data on-the-go via mobile-friendly platforms. One of the important aspects is to know how and what data to gather. However, one of the challenges is getting useful insights from the gathered data as this is a process on its own. The aims of media monitoring can vary, and analysis can be conducted by different parties.', 'As these tools primarily have a limited trial or a demo, depending on the target group (for businesses, decision/makers, media specialists, governments etc. ); this is also reflected in the business plans of the tools. Public figures may be interested in how their brand is doing and what people say about them; entrepreneurs and businesses may be interested in how their products are being received, PR specialists or agencies would be interested in keeping their eye on their clients and online campaigns. Also, understanding the depth of and belief in disinformation and its effect on democracy or a military operation, governments and military organisations can use media monitoring to serve their interests. The gathered data can provide many insights into current or past conversations about a certain topic, opinions of the public, identify sources or originators of information, and more.', 'It all can be done manually by creating a systematic overview of when, what, and how something was posted. For large amounts of work, automation is helpful to process data. With automation, third-party tools and getting data directly from social media platforms is possible. The analysis can be done based on different levels, starting from hashtags or finding trending topics, but also in a more complex way of understanding how something was commented, for example, searching for negative comments about a brand. Therefore, the main functionalities that help make sense of the data would then include real-time listening, analysis, access to historical data, and visualisation of data via dashboards.', 'In order to get information, there are various ways to get the data—either programmatically, using the methods officially provided by social media platforms, or using the tools discussed in this report, or manually searching social media platforms using their built-in functionality. 6 �����������������������������������������������������������������������������Social media monitoring tools are sources and they can analyse a lot of data extremely useful for understanding the and provide deep insights.

But, before deciding to use a commercial tool for social media monitoring, it is important to decide on goals for monitoring social media and develop a strategy for media monitoring. This process was covered in the publication “Social Media Monitoring: A Primer” by NATO StratCom COE.6 Once it is clear what the strategy and goals are summarised in the table below (the are, you can begin to assess which tool same criteria were used during this research available on the market will best help to to assess eight different tools): achieve those goals.

The challenges brought by the multi-lingual online and social media information space hinders the wide adoption of current AI in social media monitoring tools. For example, 12 ����������������������������������������������������������������������������training/fine-tuning models to perform already widely used tasks, such as named entity recognition (NER) or sentiment analysis in smaller, less supported languages, is a difficult task due to lack of normalised, well-balanced cross-lingual datasets.13 As quality comes first, such products are usually fine-tuned for large and well-supported languages, such as English, Russian, and others. In some cases, less supported language documents are translated to English (or another well-supported language) and then used in AI-enabled processing pipelines. Another challenge arises when trying to deploy AI models at scale on large data corpora, which require significant time/computing resources which might be the reason some of the companies still stick to classical Machine Learning (ML) text processing techniques.', 'But cloud computing seems to be solving this issue and we will gradually see more and more multi-lingual transformer models being deployed, enabling semantic search functionality, improved topic modelling, NER, sentiment analysis, and more. From an analyst’s perspective, AI tools can assist in more sophisticated social media analysis: semantic search and topic modelling can help to uncover networks of people talking about a specific topic, it can help to find other (related) topics they are interested in, how they are divided geographically or between social communities. Analysing influencers and opinion leaders can help in times of crisis, for instance, in the case of a disinformation campaign on Hindu and Muslim clashes in Assam, India, it was later discovered by Indian officials that only a few individuals sent out the misleading information, with one person sending out 20,000 messages.14 Opinion mining can help to understand not only what overall sentiment people are expressing, but in a more granular manner their specific opinions towards the mentioned entities. It should be stressed that opinion mining in all social media monitoring tools still is in the early stages and provides rather general or overall sentiment and lacks accuracy, especially for articles or posts on political topics. For AI, it is still difficult to determine, for example, which party of the conflict the author is negative about.', 'Using markers on the word war and labelling the text negative can be misleading. Therefore, it can be useful to look at the sentiment trend for desired topics in a political context. However, for all reviewed monitoring tools, AI is still in the early stages and can provide general sentiment indicators. Similar challenges are true for emotion detection. For example, GCAM15 proves to be a powerful measure of various emotions in news articles which are processed and stored in the GDELT database.', 'Without a doubt, fully- automated understanding of the emotional tone of conversations in social media can be beneficial, but current AI tools cannot be fully relied on to accurately detect emotions in ��������������������������������������������������������������������������� 13social media.16 However, the estimation of sentiment analysis is improving due to rapidly evolving transformer17 models. According to an article:18 “For efficient social media monitoring, brands need to go through and learn from all user-generated content, including images.” Training the models to recognise logos and other elements in the picture will give further insights to the party monitoring a specific topic. More sophisticated capabilities for the slightly more distant future are promised by a newly emerging type of model called vision-transformer19 that allows for leveraging the benefits of transformer architecture in computer vision. One of the major fall-backs of current AI is that it lacks contextual awareness. However, the role of current, yet rapidly evolving, AI in social media monitoring tools is expected to grow and bring monitoring tools to the next level towards more semantic, more context aware, and language agnostic products.', '6.

Data refers to the ability of the tool to collect and store data from social media platforms: how many sources are included, how much information is collected from each search, and for how long historical data is available. Search refers to the ability of the tool to search and filter data from social media platforms, how granulated the search is, and how many filtering options are available.', 'Accessibility refers to the platform’s ease of use, learning material availability, and quality of support.
